    <string name="txt_testimonials_detail2">\"Living in the middle of Arkansas and having no tutor of Qur\'an,
        a desperate condition for me. My friend told me about QuranReading.com,
        where there is no age limit for students. I have started taking Quran classes three days a week.
        Now, my two sons are also students of their tutors.
        I will highly recommend you all to try their Quran Learning program for once.\"
